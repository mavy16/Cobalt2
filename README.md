## Setup
**Run**

Run `npm start` to start a webserver and the Bare server. You may deploy Cobalt by using an external bare server and a static file host. Cobalt must be built before attempting to start.

**Build**

Run `npm run build` to build the app for production to the `build` folder.

**Development**

Run `npm run dev` to run the app in development mode.

**Deploy**

Click a button at the top of this page and follow the directions for an easy way to host Cobalt.

## Configuration

**Obfuscation**

File: [/src/consts.js](https://github.com/cognetwork-dev/Cobalt/blob/main/src/consts.js)

`const obfuscation = true | false;` - Choose to obfuscate text

**GitHub and Discord**

File: [/src/consts.js](https://github.com/cognetwork-dev/Cobalt/blob/main/src/consts.js)

`const github = "string";` - Update the Github links

`const discord = "string";` - Update the Discord link

**Bare Server**

File: [/public/uv/uv.config.js](https://github.com/cognetwork-dev/Cobalt/blob/main/public/uv/uv.config.js)

`bare: url,` - Ultraviolet bare server

## Goal
My goal for Cobalt was to make a proxy site that is very simple and easy to use, with only a side panel instead of pages, which you could access on any site. Along with having it be simple and easy to use, I also wanted it to have many configuration options and an extension system where the community could build unique tools to help you better use the web.

I will continue to work on Cobalt, and I hope to achieve everything I want in this project.

Overall it turned out very well, and if I were to choose a web proxy to use, I would select Cobalt!
